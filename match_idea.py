for each of the possible tile match types evaluate each in terms of value from the bottom most matched 3.

If there is a bomb then will find the L's and the T's, if there is something more complex will also look for these.

The functionality of each is determined by that match function so that at the very minimal if there are only 3 in a row then this will be evaluated first.
